<!--
	Abdra Commander can store and load user content (including settings) from different locations.
	This file specifies the location of the user content.
	
	The possible values of the location:
	
		IN_USER_HOME_FOLDER
				The folder "Abdracmd-User-Content" in the user's home folder will be used.
				Recommended if you use Abdracmd on your home computer or on a laptop.
		
		IN_APP_FOLDER
				The folder "User-Content" inside the Abdra Commander folder will be used.
				Recommended if you use Abdracmd from a USB stick for example.
		
		CUSTOM_FOLDER
				A custom folder will be used which has to be specified in the "customFolder" tag after the location type.
	
	If this XML file is invalid, or an invalid location type is given, or "customFolder" is not specified in case of CUSTOM_FOLDER,
	IN_USER_HOME_FOLDER will be used as the default user content location.
